# Title: Belly Button Challenge
This project visualizes a data set that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

# Project Description:
What does this application do?
This application filters the belly button dataset based on a user selection to show the top 10 OTUs per individual included in the sample, displays corresponsding demographic data, and displays the top 10 OTUs in a bubble chart to easily visualize the sample sizes against one another. 

# What technologies are used?
Javascript, d3, Plotly

# Future Features: 
When time permits, I hope to add more visualizations around the number of times an individual washed their navels.
